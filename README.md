## Indicator Parameters

## Indicator Usage
The Tabajara Rules II indicator uses a two-step process to generate trading signals:

1. Moving Average Calculation: The indicator calculates a moving average based on the selected period and smoothing method. The moving average is plotted as a line on the chart.

2. Candle Color Coding: The indicator assigns colors to the candles based on their relationship to the moving average. If the closing price of a candle is above the moving average, the candle is colored with the Candle_Outline_Color and Candle_Filling_Color. If the closing price is below the moving average, the candle is colored with the Candle_Outline_Color only.

The color-coded candles provide visual cues for identifying potential buy and sell opportunities in the market.
